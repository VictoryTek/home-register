## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Pre-built Image from GHCR (Recommended)

```bash
# Download production compose file
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VictoryTek/home-registry/main/docker-compose.prod.yml -o docker-compose.yml

# Start the application
VERSION=0.1.0-beta.1 docker compose up -d

# Access at http://localhost:8210
```

### Option 2: Build from Source

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/VictoryTek/home-registry.git
cd home-registry

# Start with Docker Compose
docker compose up -d

# Access at http://localhost:8210
```

---

## 🎯 First-Time Setup

1. Open http://localhost:8210
2. Complete 3-step setup wizard:
   - **Step 1:** Create admin account (username, full name, password)
   - **Step 2:** Configure 2FA settings (optional)
   - **Step 3:** Save recovery codes (print or store securely)
3. Log in with your credentials
4. Create your first inventory from the dashboard

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

### Beta Limitations

1. **No Multi-User Collaboration:** Sharing inventories with other users is not yet implemented (framework in place)
2. **Limited Mobile Optimization:** Mobile UI works but desktop experience is better
3. **No Bulk Operations:** Cannot edit or delete multiple items at once
4. **Search Functionality:** Basic search only - no advanced filters
5. **Image Management:** Single image per item (no galleries)

### Known Bugs

- **Database Migration:** Sample data removed; clean slate for testing
- **Recovery Codes:** No recovery code regeneration after initial setup
- **Export Format:** Only JSON export (no CSV or PDF options)

### Performance Notes

- **First Load:** Initial image loads may be slow (no CDN caching)
- **Large Inventories:** Performance untested with >1000 items per inventory
- **Concurrent Users:** Session management tested with <10 concurrent users

## 🔒 Security Notes

### What's Secure

✅ Passwords hashed with Argon2  
✅ HTTPS ready (configure reverse proxy)  
✅ Rate limiting enabled  
✅ SQL injection protection  
✅ XSS prevention  
✅ Non-root container execution  
✅ Regular dependency security scanning

### Recommended Setup

- **Use strong passwords** (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- **Save recovery codes** in a password manager or print them
- **Run behind reverse proxy** (Nginx, Traefik) for HTTPS
- **Regular backups** via export functionality
- **Keep updated** - watch for security releases
